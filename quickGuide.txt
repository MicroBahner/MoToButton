 Default is managing up to 16 buttons/switches.
 The default can be changed to save RAM (up to 8 buttons) or to manage up to 32 buttons (with additional RAM consumption). 
 This can be achieved by inserting '#define MAX32BUTTONS' or '#define MAX8BUTTONS'  before the #include <MoToButtons.h>.
  
 Reading the hardware state of the buttons is done by a usercallback function. 
 This enables designs where the buttons/switches are arranged in a matrix and/or read via a port extender.
 The return value of this function has to be a 8-Bit, 16-Bit or 32-Bit value according to the maximum manageable 
 number of buttons. Every button/switch is represented by one bit, where '1' means the button is pressed.

 'button_t' is automtically set to the correct type and can be used to define the type of the callback function.
 

  Constructor parameters:
    button_t (*getHWbuttons)()  Adress of the userfuction that reads the state of the buttons
    debTime                     Debouncetime in ms
    pressTime                   (in ms ) If the button is pressed longer, it is a 'long press'
                                max presstime = debTime*255
    MoToButton( button_t (*getHWbuttons)(), uint8_t debTime, uint16_t pressTime );
    example in sketch: 
        MoToButton Buttons( readFunction, 20, 500 );
  
  Methods to be called in loop:
    void    processButtons();                 // must be called in the loop frequently
                                            // if it is called less frequently than debTime, pressTime will be inaccurate
    Reading the debounced state of the Buttons/Switches:                                          
      boolean state( uint8_t buttonNbr );       // get static state of button (debounced)
      button_t allStates();                     // bit field of all buttons (debounced)
      button_t changed();                       // all bits are set where state has changed since last call
  
    Reading events:
      boolean shortPress( uint8_t buttonNbr );  // true if button was pressed short ( set when button is released, reset after call )  
      boolean longPress( uint8_t buttonNbr );   // true if button was pressed long ( set when button is released, reset after call )  
      boolean pressed( uint8_t buttonNbr );     // true if button is pressed ( reset after call )
      boolean released( uint8_t buttonNbr );    // true if button is released ( reset after call )
  
    void forceChanged(){                        // force all changed with call of next 'pressed', 'released' ore 'changed'
    void resetChanged(){                        // clear alle events of 'pressed', 'released' or 'changed'
                                                // ( longPress() and shortPress() are unaffected )
  
    Event bits are set at the corresponding edge and they are cleared 
    when read or at the next inverted edge ( pressed-> released or vice versa )

    buttonNbr is a value from 0 to max buttons-1.
